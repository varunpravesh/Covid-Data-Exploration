## Overview

This project explores COVID-19 data through structured queries and analysis to:

- Track global and regional infection trends.
- Understand mortality and recovery rates.
- Analyze vaccination progress.
- Derive insights into the effectiveness of various interventions.

## Features

- Comprehensive SQL scripts for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data.
- Analysis of critical metrics like cases, deaths, recovery rates, and vaccinations.
- Regional comparisons and time-series trends.
- Visualizable results that can be integrated into BI tools like Power BI or Tableau.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from publicly available COVID-19 datasets, including:

- [Our World in Data (OWID)](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data)
- [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

Ensure to check the respective licenses and attributions for these data sources.

## SQL Queries
